# WDI_PROJECT_4
Project 4 Final Project 

This is my final project from my Web Development Immersive course at General Assembly. The task was to single handedly build a fully functional website using a back of ruby on rails and a front end using Javascript. I decided to deciced to build a site that allows users to rent their suits out to other users for a fee. 

You can view the site here: [***Suit***](https://suit-site.herokuapp.com/ )

###What was used 

To build the site I utilised HTML5, CSS, SCSS, Javascript, Angular, nodeJs, Ruby on Rails, Express, Bootstrap, Postgres. 

###Approach to building the site

I started by setting up the back end using ruby on rails. I defined the models and the relationships between them and set up any RESTful web services I would have needed. I also set up authentications around my API.

I then continued with the front end of the app and started off by making sure I could make requests to my API. I then made sure I could access all parts of the API on the appropriate pages. After this I set up authentications around the front end of the app so that users can only use the site after they have logged in. Now that I had all the information from the API that I wanted on the page and had set up all relevant forms for users to post new data, all that was left was for me was to add styling. I finished by adding and perfecting as much of the design I could within the time frame given.

###Wins 

I am happy with the functionality and design of site and was able to put together most of site quite smoothly.  

I am especially confident using AngularJS. 

###Challenges faced 

One of the challenges I initially faced was the fact that it was a new exprience working with an external API. After doing a little bit of research and taking time to understand how external APIs work however, I was able to get it all running smoothly. 

###Future plans for the site

In the future I hope to:

Add a payment system to the site and add a function to rate users as well as the suits themselves. 

Add a function for private messaging between users.

Make the site responsive to other devices and browse by suit sizes.
